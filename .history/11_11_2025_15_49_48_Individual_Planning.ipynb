    "#### How data was collected\n",
    "This data were collected by a UBC Computer Science research group (Frank Wood’s lab). Players voluntarily joined a custom Minecraft server used for behavioral research, so they could build NPCS in Minecraft with AI.  Gameplay metrics and basic demographic information (experience, gender, age) were recorded automatically or via pre-game questionnaires. Newsletter subscription was collected through an opt-in option provided to players.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Subscribe**: a boolean, either true or false: are users subscribed to\n",
