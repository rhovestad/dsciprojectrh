    "Looking at **Figure 1**, we can see that the majority of the observations were male, underrepresenting other gender identities. Looking at **Figure 2**, we can note that our graph is significantly skewed to the right, thus most players only played for a few minutes. With Minecraft being a very long game that requires many different steps and ways to complete the game, having gamers who only played for such brief amounts of time may not make the data very accurate in terms of what true Minecraft gamers look like. Looking at **Figure 3**, we can see that more than half of the gamers chose to subscribe to the newsletter. **Figure 4** shows us that most gamers self-identified as Amateur. Finally, **Figure 5** shows us that the majority of gamers were just under 20, probably  making them university students."

Newsletter subscription was also collected, but it seems unclear what this newsletter entails exactly. \n",

    "I wanted to complete the Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization and the Data before formulating a question to analyze. Now that that's done, I've noticed many things that have helped me choose the specific question I want to analyze. Seeing the massive skewness in some variables and the greater representation of men (75%) in the dataset, I have decided I want to further examine the reasearch group's second broad question of interest: \"What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\"\n",

    "I would use the our tidy dataset that I produced earlier in Exploratory Data Analysis. Next, due to skewness of played_hours (Figure 2), I might choose to omit any players that played less than a specific number of minutes, and then upscale to ensure we have more datapoints. I will split the dataset into training and testing subsets, for example, 70% for training and 30% for testing, so that the predictive model can be trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on unseen observations. These wrangling steps will prepare a clean, well-structured dataset ready for modeling."

    "Because the target variable subscribe is binary (subscribe vs. not subscribe), and we have a small set of predictors (*Age*, *played_hours*, *experience*), k-NN offers a straightforward and interpretable classification method that fits our analysis. k-NN classifies a new observation by finding its k closest training-observations, then assigning the class most common among those neighbors.\n",
